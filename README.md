$\huge{\color{purple}{\textsf{SpaceX Project}}}$

SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each. This is a big savings when SpaceX can reuse the first stage. 

In this project, we predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully by using Data Science and Machine Learning models.

>
> - **Data collection** <br/>
> The data was gathered from the `SpaceX API`, and Jupyter notebook `DataCollection_SpaceX_Project` explains the process of data collection.
> - **Classification models to preform predective analysis** <br/>
> Jupyter notebook `SpaceX_Project` explains:
>   * Data Pre-processing  <br/>
>   * Data Standardization  <br/>
>   * Search for the Hpyerparameter (best parameters) for supervised machine learning classifiers: `LogisticRegression`, `Support Vector Machine (SVM)`, `Decission Trees`, and `K Nearest Neighbor`. <br/>
>   * Search for method that performs best using train-test data.
